
Text::Document is a collection of modules which allow to operate
on text documents from the perspective of Information Retrieval.

Text::Document scans documents, extracts terms, compares pairs
of documents using the Jaccard and Cosine similarity measures.

Text::Bloom allows to compute  Bloom filters which compactly
store information about term presence in documents, thereby
allowing for efficient storage of document 'signatures'.

Text::DocumentCollection is a collection of documents, allowing
for persistency and for such calculations as the Inverse Document
Frequency (IDF).

Version 1.04 of the package Text::Document is
Copyright (C) 2001 Andrea Spinelli  and Walter Vannini

All documents in this package can be  used with the same limitations
as Perl itself.

Anyway, we are eager to know about your experiences with this thing, at
spinellia@acm.org and/or walter@humans.net.

Version 1.05 eliminates the binary checksum of Text::Document
and introduces a textual one which is sexier, e.g. in XML.

Version 1.06 corrects a quirk in the tests and changes the size of
a prime, p, used in Text::Bloom, which caused errors on my linux box.
